You will be able to catch me on the Day 1 Keynote at Google NEXT 2017 in London alongside Google Cloud CTO Brian Stevens. I will be talking about the global migration of Lush’s e-commerce infrastructure to Google Cloud in a record-breaking 22 days.

I was invited as part of Lush Digital to talk at Google NEXT 2017 about the incredible migration that my amazing Engineering team at Lush (Dan Richards, Lee Hill, Simon Ince and myself) along with two partners: Ancoris (project coordination) and Clarinet (technical) delivered within a record-breaking 22 days.

The migration came about as our existing black-box infrastructure partners contract was coming to an end and our need for scalability, ownership, and future-proofing of our technology / architecture was growing rapidly. After attending one of the first Google NEXT events in London back in 2016 with one of my senior engineers we were sold that Cloud is the future for the business. Google Cloud aligned perfectly to Lush Cosmetics ethical approach alongside other benefits such as being powered by 100% renewable energy and supporting open-source communities which were some of the foundations in which Lush Digital’s engineering team was built upon.

As soon I spoke with my fellow leadership team about the above the decision was made to make the transition to Google Cloud rather than renew our existing contract which gave us 28 days to make the migration. Within a couple of days we had reached out to Google, secured partners, signed contracts, planned our project and had the first lines of code written. The rest was stressful history.

Maybe add something further in here about the project?…

I also had the opportunity on Day 2 to talk alongside Google and Clarinet about the actual migration from conception to delivery and all the bumps inbetween. You can hear all about it within the video below:
